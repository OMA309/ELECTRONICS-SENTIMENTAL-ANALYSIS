# ELECTRONICS-SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS
This project demonstrates a comprehensive sentiment analysis of electronics data using Microsoft Power Platform tools. The dataset is cleaned and transformed using Power Query, manipulated using DAX formulas, and visualized using Power BI.

## OBJECTIVES 
The objective of this project is to analyze customer sentiment towards various electronics products, identifying trends, and insights that can inform business decisions. The analysis is based on a dataset of customer reviews, ratings, and feedback.

## Methodology:
### Data Cleaning: 
Power Query is used to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling tasks such as:
- Data import and transformation
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Data normalization and aggregation
  
### Data Manipulation: 
DAX formulas are used to manipulate the data, performing tasks such as:
- Calculating sentiment scores using natural language processing techniques
- Creating calculated columns for sentiment categorization (positive, negative, neutral)
- Aggregating data for visualization
  
### Data Visualization: 
Power BI is used to create interactive and dynamic visualizations, including:
- Sentiment analysis dashboards
- Product rating distributions
- Customer feedback word clouds
- Geographic analysis of customer sentiment

### Key Features:
- Sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Power Query
- Data manipulation and calculation using DAX formulas
- Interactive and dynamic visualizations using Power BI
- Insights into customer sentiment towards various electronics products

### Technologies Used:
- Microsoft Power Query
- Microsoft DAX
- Microsoft Power BI
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
  
### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a sample electronics review dataset, containing customer reviews, ratings, and feedback.
